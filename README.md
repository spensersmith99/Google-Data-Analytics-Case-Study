# Google-Data-Analytics-Case-Study
My Google Data Analytics Case Study.

The goal of this case study was to analyze data from a bike share compnay called Cyclistic and help determine a way for them to convert more customers into monthly susbcribers.

The project began by cleaning and processing an Excel worksheet supplied by Google. I applied the following to the data set in order to gain a clearer understanding of the data and its potential purpose:
* removed duplicates and blanks
* sorted data based on on date of transaction (oldest to newest)
* added trip duration and day of week columns
* applied conditional formatting to User Type column to easily identify who was a subscriber and who was not
* added a filter to Gender column
* concatenated date and time into one column

Next, I analyzed the data to find some meaningful information about it:
* created pivot tables that contained information on average trip duration and count of trips by weekday
* graphed daily transactions based on what day of the week it was 
* graphed transactions based on if they were male/female and subscriber/nonsubscriber
* performed calculations like average birth year of customer(1982) and average trip duration(00:16:56) and busiest day of week(Thursday)

Finally I offered up some solutions moving forward based on my findings:
* Since subscribers are mostly males who use the bike for short trips during the week(likely commuting to and from work), advertisements targeted at young, working class men in inner cities would be ideal to capture a larger target audience. 
* Because the work week is often the most popular days, offering an incentive(discount, bonus points, etc.) for people to use the bikes on the weekend would help.
* Since most of the total bike user population is already comprised of subscribers, time is best spent acquiring new customers rather than trying to convert current ones into subscribers.
