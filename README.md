# Google-Data-Analytics-Case-Study
My Google Data Analytics Case Study.

The goal of this case study was to analyze data from a bike share company called Cyclistic and help determine a way for them to convert more customers into monthly susbcribers.

The project began by cleaning and processing an Excel worksheet supplied by Google. I applied the following to the data set in order to gain a clearer understanding of the data and its potential purpose:
* removed duplicates and blanks
* sorted data based on date of transaction (oldest to newest)
* added trip duration and day of week columns
* applied conditional formatting to User Type column to easily identify who was a subscriber and who was not
* added a filter to Gender column
* concatenated date and time into one column

Next, I analyzed the data to gain some meaningful knowledge on it:
* created pivot tables that contained information on average trip duration and count of trips by weekday
* graphed daily transactions based on what day of the week it was 
* graphed transactions based on if they were male/female and subscriber/nonsubscriber
* performed calculations like average birth year of customer(1982), average trip duration(00:16:56), and busiest day of the week(Thursday)

Next, blah blah blah SQL.

Finally I offered up some solutions based on my findings:
* Since subscribers are mostly males who use the bike for short trips during the week(likely commuting to and from work), advertisements intended for young, business professionals who work in inner cities would be ideal to capture a larger target audience. 
* Because the work week is often the most popular days, offering an incentive(discount, bonus points, etc.) for people to use the bikes on the weekend would be beneficial to maintaining a more consistent revenue.
* Since most of the total bike user population is already comprised of subscribers, resources are best spent acquiring new customers rather than trying to convert current ones into subscribers.
