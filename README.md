# Google-Data-Analytics-Case-Study
My Google Data Analytics Case Study.

The goal of this case study was to analyze data from a bike share compnay called Cyclistic and help determine a way for them to convert more customers into monthly susbcribers.

The project began by cleaning and processing an Excel worksheet supplied by Google. I applied the following to the data set in order to gain a clearer understanding of the data and its potential purpose:
* removed duplicates and blanks
* sorted data based on on date of transaction (oldest to newest)
* added trip duration and day of week columns
* applied conditional formatting to User Type column to easily identify who was a subscriber and who was not
* added a filter to Gender column
* concatenated date and time into one column
